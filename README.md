## The Freenode Community & Channel Policies

You should take some time to read the [Freenode Policies](http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml). [Wheaton's Law](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wheaton%27s+Law) applies on the IRC channel. Any violation of the Freednode policies or being a **1!@)** will get you banned.
