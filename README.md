#### Registering and Logging In

You should choose a nickname (known as a *nick*). Once you've decided upon a cool name, you should register it:

`/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <youremail@example.com>`

When you need to log back in, you will need to `identify` yourself to claim your account. You don't want strangers parading around as you, do you? To identify yourself, enter:

`/msg NickServ IDENTIFY <nick> <password>`

After logging in the first time, you should force anyone using your nick to login (otherwise they will be kicked off the server), preventing potential abuse:

`/msg NickServ SET ENFORCE ON`

#### The Freenode Community & Channel Policies
